<h1 class="title">Round 12 Code Guessing</h1>
</header>
<p><a href="https://cg.esolangs.gay/12">This week’s challenge</a> was to
write an evaluator for arithmetic expressions. There were many
restrictions on input data: Only the four basic operations, no unary
operators (e.g. no positive and negative signs), no division by zero, no
whitespace or other extraneous characters, no parentheses or brackets,
no multi-digit numbers, and no signed 32 bit overflow. These extreme
restrictions mean bountiful optimizations which were used both for
performance and obfuscation.</p>
<p>For this little write-up, all submissions, rather than code review
and compression size, will be tested on validity and performance.
Because my submission was performance focused, I wanted to measure the
performance on every submission (ego is a bitch, nyaa~). For actual
submissions, the <code>entry</code> function will be timed on an 11
kilobyte file <code>small.txt</code> (11_317 bytes) and on a 1 gigabyte
file <code>big.txt</code> (1_000_000_001 bytes). For Python submissions,
the <code>entry</code> function will be timed only on
<code>small.txt</code>. Keep in mind, a function which runs for 1 second
on <code>small.txt</code> will run for about 24.5 hours on
<code>big.txt</code>, assuming linear speed. As for validity, programs
that fail on large data (e.g. 1000+ operations) a.k.a. programs that do
not have <code>O(1)</code> memory usage, will be noted as such but still
considered valid. Technically all submissions are at least
<code>O(n)</code> since every allowed language asserts the data must be
allocated in memory, but so long as the algorithm itself is
<code>O(1)</code> (e.g. if the data could be streamed with minimal
re-writing) it counts.</p>
<h2 id="entry-1-8eaf3db6f25850557a0697981ec5435d.python2">Entry #1
(8eaf3db6f25850557a0697981ec5435d.python2)</h2>
<p>Boring.</p>
<p>Only valid on Python 2 (as correctly specified by the file
extension). Fails on too large data.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p><code>small.txt -&gt; 3ms</code></p>
<p>Attempts to run the program on larger data (e.g. 12+ kilobytes) were
met with a <code>RecursionError</code>. Attempts to increase the
recursion limit were met with Python itself silently terminating. No, I
don’t know.</p>
<h2 id="entry-2-dear_eternity.py">Entry #2 (dear_eternity.py)</h2>
<p>Lambda calculus is cool, and the way it attempts to avoid the problem
of Python float division is in equal measures cute and misguided.
Otherwise, boring.</p>
<p>Only valid on Python 2. Same issues as #1.</p>
<h3 id="performance-1">Performance</h3>
<p><code>Exactly the same as Entry #1.</code></p>
<h2 id="entry-3-spaghetti.calc">Entry #3 (spaghetti.calc)</h2>
<p>A basic substitution algorithm.</p>
<p>Valid! Fails on data that does not fit in memory.</p>
<h3 id="algorithm-overview">Algorithm Overview</h3>
<p>Evaluation is done in two passes, one for multiplication and
division, and then one for addition and subtraction. The entire
expression is turned into a character and int list. Then, in a loop, the
program searches for the appropriate operation (<code>*</code> or
<code>/</code> in the first pass, and <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>
in the second pass), then performs that operation on the two adjacent
numbers, and then replaces those three items in the list with the single
number result. The “numbers” start as type <code>str</code>, but for
every operation the numbers are cast as <code>int</code> which is
idempotent.</p>
<h3 id="performance-2">Performance</h3>
<p><code>small.txt -&gt; 1671ms</code></p>
<p>Given the use of adding lists together, I imagine this function runs
in <code>O(n^2)</code> time at the very least, in which case I doubt it
could get through a gigabyte in our lifetimes.</p>
<h2 id="entry-4-code_guessing.rs">Entry #4 (code_guessing.rs)</h2>
<p>This entry uses <code>rustc</code>’s const evaluation to calculate
the result. For literal math expressions like the input data for this
challenge, this optimization is present even in debug builds.</p>
<p>I had to do some finnagling to get this to run on my Windows machine:
removing the <code>tmp</code> directory and renaming the compiled output
file <code>eval.exe</code>.</p>
<p>Valid, unless <code>rustc</code> is not a recognized command
(e.g. not installed, not in PATH) or does not successfully compile the
program (e.g. is a completely different version or a different program
entirely). Fails on data large enough to stack overflow the
compiler.</p>
<h3 id="performance-3">Performance</h3>
<p><code>small.txt -&gt; 6424ms</code></p>
<p>Despite being written in Rust, it’s still slower than molasses
dripping off a spoon. Attempts to run the program on larger data were
met with <code>thread 'rustc' has overflowed its stack</code>.</p>
<h2 id="entry-5-py">Entry #5 (py)</h2>
<p>A basic shunting yard-ish algorithm.</p>
<p>Valid! Fails on data that does not fit in memory.</p>
<h3 id="performance-4">Performance</h3>
<p><code>small.txt -&gt; 802ms</code></p>
<p>The use of popping non-last elements and inserts probably makes this
<code>O(n^2)</code> as well.</p>
<h2 id="entry-6-cg.c">Entry #6 (cg.c)</h2>
<p>An exercise in C hell.</p>
<p>This entry is invalid by being non-functional on every level. As
such, performance cannot be fairly measured. Theoretically, this
algorithm is a recursive descent parser/evaluator.</p>
<h3 id="code-review">Code Review</h3>
<p>This code seems to be the product of a very rushed job. So, in lieu
of performance testing, I think this entry deserves a breakdown of all
of its awful bits.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>entry</code> function fails to return anything.
<code>t();</code> should be replaced with <code>R t();</code> where
<code>R</code> is a macro alias for <code>return</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Three of the macros go unused (<code>ID</code>, <code>P</code>,
and <code>DO</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Two of the macros are only used once (<code>V</code>,
<code>B</code>), which seems to defeat the purpose of a macro. And of
course, specifying <code>void</code> arguments for just one of the
functions which take no arguments seems weird.</p></li>
<li><p>The parsing simply does not work. In fixing and deobfuscating the
code, I managed to get addition and subtraction chains working, but any
use of multiplication or division mostly resulted in erroneous output
and/or early termination.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘state’ of this program is appalling. Every bit of execution
is so intertwined that it took me a good twenty minutes just to get a
sense of where this code went wrong. If the code actually worked, this
point would be a positive for a code guessing competition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe I’ll make a blog someday where I can ramble on about
programming practices and the quality of various code structures. Until
then I shall simply spill these urges here.</p>
<h2 id="entry-7-vic.rs">Entry #7 (vic.rs)</h2>
<p>This is what I submitted! Congrats to INSERT_PEOPLE_HERE for sussing
me out. The obfuscation was inspired by the cover art of one of my
favorite albums, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_to_the_Thief">Hail to the Thief
by Radiohead</a>. You can see every buzzword I used here.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Hail to the Thief</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The title <code>vic.rs</code> was originally going to be
<code>vice.rs</code> but that seemed tacky and not obfuscated enough.
Meow!</p>
<p>Every aspect of this code was made to generate the fastest x64
assembly possible, meaning a liberal use of <code>unsafe</code>. I would
go so far as to say this algorithm might be the fastest possible single
threaded solution, perhaps with minor optimizations I have not yet
tested or discovered.</p>
<p>This entry is valid.</p>
<h3 id="algorithm-overview-1">Algorithm Overview</h3>
<p>Order of operations can be reduced to a parsing problem. Without
brackets, every input expression can be seen as a single sum of
products. We can determine if all of a product has been evaluated just
by checking if the next symbol is a <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, or
end of file. Thus, every product once finished can be accumulated in a
single sum, and so we only need to keep two variables to maintain
calculation state: one for the current product (<code>LIQUOR</code>),
and one for the current sum (<code>PROSECUTED</code>).</p>
<p>You can see my love for Rust in this code, particularly in the
language’s type and method system. <code>OIL</code> is essentially a
byte iterator over a string with methods <code>SCREEN</code> (a.k.a.
“next”), which calls <code>COCKTAILS</code> (a.k.a. “next_unchecked”),
which calls <code>GRANDGUIGNOL</code> (a.k.a. “peek_unchecked”).
Interestingly, the assembly is unchanged if <code>OIL</code> is
rewritten to accept a <code>&amp;str</code> as a field rather than a
pointer and length. Go, Rust!</p>
<p>There are two occurrences of <code>unreachable_unchecked</code>. This
is an unsafe function used to mark a branch of execution as “undefined
behavior”, which allows the compiler to make more aggressive
optimizations than otherwise possible. The first use asserts that no
divisor will ever be zero, saving a branch to a panic; this is
equivalent to the <code>unchecked_div</code> intrinsic. The second one
is meant to exclude the possibility of a null terminator ever being
read. The same thing could have been accomplished with
<code>Option&lt;NonZeroU8&gt;</code>, which is still just one byte in
memory. In the obfuscation process this value was changed from 0 to 19,
but an incorrect cast made the unreachable branch useless. Both of these
cause minor performance increases on <code>big.txt</code> (when
correctly implemented, of course.) That’s actually kind of a lie - we’ll
get to that later.</p>
<h3 id="troubling-findings">Troubling Findings</h3>
<p>At some point in the obfuscation process (I have no clue when), I
made a change or changes that made the code run <em>faster</em>.
Significantly so. The hot loop was reduced from 36 instructions to 32,
resulting in a dramatic performance increase (1.8s runtime down to
1.3s). I can see two new optimizations LLVM was able to make for the
final code.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Addition/subtraction is now handled branchlessly, saving one
compare and branch.</p></li>
<li><p>A move between registers <code>r9d</code> and <code>eax</code> at
the start and end of the loop have been optimized away.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I suspect both of these were caused by the switch from a
<code>match</code> statement to an <code>if/else if</code> chain, which
is unfortunate! It just goes to show that for high performance code,
it’s important to check that every abstraction is actually zero-cost.
Evidently, it is also important to check a disassembler when obfuscating
your code!</p>
<p>Now we get into the downright strange. You know those
<code>unreachable_unchecked</code> calls I was talking about a minute
ago? Turns out those actually hurt performance, <em>but only on
<code>small.txt</code></em>, consistently increasing the runtime from
4.4 microseconds to 5.2 microseconds. On smaller data or on
<code>big.txt</code>, the performance difference is negligible or an
improvement. Additionally, enabling link time optimization <em>also</em>
caused a performance hit, but not when I tested it again on the final
obfuscated release, where it noticably <em>increased</em> performance,
which means either the obfuscation helped with that as well or some
malevolent god has it out for me this week - with programming, it can
really go either way.</p>
<h3 id="performance-5">Performance</h3>
<pre><code>small.txt -&gt; 0ms
big.txt -&gt; 1317ms</code></pre>
<p>With all the optimization bugs fixed (at least the ones I know of)
this goes down to:</p>
<p><code>big.txt -&gt; 1269ms</code></p>
<p>Further potential optimizations to be considered are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Skipping a product if there’s a multiplication by zero. This
could definitely decrease performance in the worst case.</p></li>
<li><p>Using null-terminated strings. Very idiomatic!</p></li>
<li><p>Using concurrent execution (e.g. threads, async) to parallelize
computation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>God I am good at talking about myself.</p>
<h2 id="entry-8-fuck.py">Entry #8 (fuck.py)</h2>
<p>The best laugh I have had in a long while. The core of it is a
brainfuck interpreter which accepts a program and returns the string of
characters it produces. (mind you, this is the second round in a row
with a totally non-functional input operator a.k.a. <code>,</code>). The
string is then evaluated and assigned to the variable
<code>entry</code>. What does the brainfuck program output? The string
“eval”, of course.</p>
<p>Only valid on Python 2. Same issues as #1.</p>
<h3 id="performance-6">Performance</h3>
<p><code>Same as #1. Same as it ever was.</code></p>
<h2 id="entry-9-razetime.py">Entry #9 (razetime.py)</h2>
<p>Converts an expression into a Stax program and runs it on an online
interpreter via Google Chrome and Selenium. Delectably clever, but I
don’t think I’ll be trying it out on my own machine.</p>
<p>Valid, as long as you fill in the paths to Chrome and ChromeDriver
and can use (https://staxlang.xyz). Fails on data that does not fit in
memory, or, more likely, data too large to be put into a URL and
executed online.</p>
<h3 id="performance-7">Performance</h3>
<p><code>Pretty bad, I would imagine.</code></p>
<h2 id="entry-10-12.c">Entry #10 (12.c)</h2>
<p>This one is actually quite simple. The program keeps the expression
as a list, and every step, it finds the left-most operator that can be
evaluated, does the operation, and moves down 2 spaces every element
that’s to the right. Wildly inefficient in many ways, leaks memory, and
all in GNU style to top it all off. What more could you ask of C
code?</p>
<p>Valid! Fails on data that does not fit in memory.</p>
<h3 id="performance-8">Performance</h3>
<p><code>small.txt -&gt; 21ms</code></p>
<p>On much larger inputs, performance really tanks. There are multiple
<code>O(n^2)</code> operations in the entry function such as looping
through the entire expression and deleting portions of it every
iteration. So once again, running this submission on
<code>big.txt</code> is out of reach for us mortals.</p>
<h2 id="entry-11-discord.py">Entry #11 (discord.py)</h2>
<p>Delightfully creative! The bot token was invalid when I tried it, and
I can’t find any bot <code>Reimu#1987</code>, so unfortunately no
sleuthing to be done there. Doubly unfortunate is that Yuwuko did not
submit, so the clear impersonation was a bit less effective!</p>
<p>Invalid because the <code>entry</code> function does not match the
signature specified. Otherwise, valid unless data can’t fit in
memory.</p>
<h3 id="performance-9">Performance</h3>
<p><code>small.txt -&gt; 474ms</code></p>
<h2 id="entry-12-aaa.c">Entry #12 (aaa.c)</h2>
<p>I am told this is output from the <a
href="https://github.com/westes/flex">Flex lexer</a>.</p>
<p>Valid? The programs calls <code>malloc</code> and
<code>realloc</code> so it seems that it might fail on sufficiently
large data.</p>
<h3 id="performance-10">Performance</h3>
<pre><code>small.txt -&gt; 0ms
big.txt -&gt; 19856ms</code></pre>
<h2 id="entry-13-mdas32.py">Entry #13 (mdas32.py)</h2>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Valid? Appears to be at least <code>O(n)</code> space complexity so
would fail on larger data.</p>
<h3 id="performance-11">Performance</h3>
<p><code>small.txt -&gt; 13ms</code></p>
<h2 id="entry-14-ocr_tron.py">Entry #14 (ocr_tron.py)</h2>
<p>Hoo mama.</p>
<h3 id="performance-12">Performance</h3>
<p><code>small.txt -&gt; 0ms big.txt -&gt; 1948ms</code></p>
<p>Tested on the C code itself, which is much less funny than the
submitted Python code but much more technically interesting, and
obviously much more practical to time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Coming into this round, I had two hidden objectives. One was to write
the fastest submission ran on 1 GB of data (or faster than Lyric’s, at
least). The other was for zero people to guess me this round, a high
hope considering the probability of that is only about 35% with random
guessing alone. Turns out I succeeded at the first and miserably failed
at the second (I was the most guessed person of the entire round).
