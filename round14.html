<h1 id="round-14-code-guessing">Round 14 Code Guessing</h1>
<p><a href="https://cg.esolangs.gay/14">This week’s challenge</a> was to
calculate a dot product.</p>
<h2 id="entry-1-written-in-rustc">Entry #1 (written in Rust/C)</h2>
<p>This one has a medley of solutions with varying levels of accuracy
and performance. <code>entry</code> calls one of these functions at
random.</p>
<ul>
<li>An “idiomatic” function which uses Rust’s robust iterator methods.
Bizarrely, the <code>zip</code> function is used rather than the method,
and <code>fold</code> is used where <code>sum</code> would do the same
thing. Here’s how a truly idiomatic solution would look, in my
opinion:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">fn</span> entry(a<span class="op">:</span> <span class="op">&amp;</span>[<span class="dt">f64</span>]<span class="op">,</span> b<span class="op">:</span> <span class="op">&amp;</span>[<span class="dt">f64</span>]) <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">f64</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    a<span class="op">.</span>iter()<span class="op">.</span>zip(b)<span class="op">.</span>map(<span class="op">|</span>(u<span class="op">,</span> v)<span class="op">|</span> u <span class="op">*</span> v)<span class="op">.</span>sum()</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><p>A “simple” function which is programmed in a C-like way.</p></li>
<li><p>A “C” function which is a call to some basic C code compiled
along with the project.</p></li>
<li><p>A “parallel” function which uses Rayon. The initial Vec
allocation makes this almost 8 times slower than the idiomatic
function.</p></li>
<li><p>A “lame SIMD” function which is just kinda ugly.</p></li>
<li><p>A “SIMD” function. It checks every iteration if it has at least 4
floats left rather than calculating parity before the loop, which
probably incurs a performance penalty.</p></li>
<li><p>A “FMA” function which requires an x86 with support for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA_instruction_set">FMA instruction
set</a>. With this, it’s able to add 4 floats with one instruction. It
has the same parity issue as the SIMD function. If FMA is not available,
it falls back on the SIMD function. It also uses
<code>mem::transmute</code> which I really hope isn’t
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>An “approximation” function which attempts to interpolate a dot
product in a very incorrect but amusing manner.</p></li>
<li><p>A “Parallel SIMD” function which goes unused in
<code>entry</code>. It takes a threadpool and gives a slice for each
thread to work with, each using the SIMD function
independently.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I calculated the performance of each of these functions on the
provided 100000 element slices. Out of 10 runs, the last 3 were averaged
to eliminate warm-up. This obviously does not show variance or warm-up
time, and isn’t rigorous to begin with, so take this data as you will.
The final calculation result is also displayed.</p>

Simple - (took 66.8µs) 25080.8969547973

<h2 id="entry-2-softdouble.c">Entry #2 (softdouble.c)</h2>
<p>This entry is evil, and uses two 32-bit floats to calculate 64-bit
floats in software. It is beautiful, wonderfully executed, and
reasonably accurate. The doc comments are lovely. I want to kiss this
person on the lips.</p>
<p>From the interview:</p>
<pre><code>Coral: it&#39;s a mostly-compliant double implementation using only float operations. took way more work than i thought it would but it&#39;s like correct in &gt;99% of the cases
...
but the gist of it is just, extract the exponent and mantissa from the two floats representing the double, then do whatever operations on the thing and then turn it back

Olive: so do f1 and f2 contain valid float values?
    
Coral: in almost all cases they do. a float is only NaN when the exponent is all ones, which is not very likely. but when it does happen, the code breaks</code></pre>
<h2 id="entry-3-golf.py">Entry #3 (golf.py)</h2>
<p>My submission! This is hopefully a (nearly) perfect golf of every
language allowed for this round. They are all encoded within
<code>file</code>, along with some other goodies like my true identity.
A single command line argument is passed and used as a key. Here is
every encoded message.</p>
<p><code>--c</code></p>

<p>The top comment is a discord message link from the organizer allowing
solutions that only work on one compiler. This code implicitly uses
<code>size_t</code> without the proper include, which is only legal on
MSVC (and Clang targeting MSVC, which is what I used). Please admire the
awful <code>*r++**b++</code>.</p>
<p><code>--python</code></p>

<p>This saves one character off the naive import. Of course this is only
legal if Numpy is allowed.</p>

<p>This link points to this Discord message: [[Pasted image
20220317220849.png]] If a guesser were to find this key, they would be
treated to the identity of the submitter!</p>
<p><code>A</code></p>
<pre><code>DIRTYDIRTYHACKER

I know where you live.</code></pre>
<p>Just a fun little message. This is impossible to display on the main
program, and would only be seen by people who were reverse-engineering
<code>file</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s how the program works. First, if the current execution thread
isn’t main, or if exactly 2 command line arguments weren’t passed (the
path of the program and the user provided key), execution halts. If that
key doesn’t match the regex <code>--[a-z_]</code>, it also halts. Then
we check it against every key in <code>file</code>.</p>
<p>The construction of <code>file</code> is pretty straightforward. It
is a collection of binary chunks appended together. Each chunk consists
of 32 bytes representing the SHA-256 hash of its key in little endian,
followed by one byte representing the length of its message, followed by
the message itself. This message is encrypted with the Vigenère cipher
using the key. This means you have to know the original key in order to
decrypt the message.</p>
<p>The SHA-256 hash of the user-provided key is compared against every
chunk in <code>file</code>, and if one matches the corresponding message
is decrypted and printed. Funny enough, the <code>entry</code> function
itself is used to parse the hash as a 32-byte little endian integer.</p>
<p>The choice of Vigenère cipher was intentional. It was meant to be
non-trivial but feasible to crack. The key <code>A</code> in particular
should be particularly easy. Actually, I’m realizing right now the key
that reveals me is maybe way too easy to guess. It’s difficult for me to
know!</p>
<h2 id="entry-4-entry.py">Entry #4 (entry.py)</h2>
<p>This one uses Selenium to access the code guessing website itself. We
see an inline lambda decorator, which i didn’t even know was possible.
Just when you think you’ve seen it all with Python, huh? We also see the
return of Coltrans’ <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/MESON">MESON</a>
to code guessing. Needless to say this entry is evil and I patiently
await for someone else explain it to me.</p>
<h2 id="entry-5-6-and-7">Entry #5, 6, and 7</h2>
<p>Boring.</p>
<h2 id="entry-8-inter.c">Entry #8 (inter.c)</h2>
<p>This entry uses SDL to outsource the calculation to a human with a
ruler and protractor! I’m not sure how the actual calculation is done,
but suffice to say it requires some math the submitter is displeased
with.</p>
<h2 id="entry-9-code.c">Entry #9 (code.c)</h2>
<p>A glorified assembly solution. It certainly looks handwritten.</p>
<h2 id="entry-10-dedebe92.py">Entry #10 (dedebe92.py)</h2>
<p>This entry is also evil. I think the intention is to leech off a
nearby C entry. I couldn’t get it to work, even after adjusting some
parts to work on Windows. I like this one.</p>
<h2 id="entry-11-cg.py">Entry #11 (cg.py)</h2>
<p>This entry is a who’s who of lambda calculus constructions, and oh
boy am I a sucker for lambda calculus. Do I understand it? No, not
really. But do I like it? Yes :)</p>
<p>From the interview:</p>
<pre><code>Jimothy: the initial idea was to hack together a church-encoded solution in haskell, and I got halfway through that before realising there were language restrictions

Olive: looool

Jimothy: so I thought why not python me a haskell for great good

Olive: nice

Jimothy: I wanted to do it full combinator style, but the pointfree.io code for map and fold ran into an infinite loop

Olive: i see
Olive: the use of the Fn class is really cool, where&#39;d you get the idea?

Jimothy: I wrote that so I could emulate `(.)` and `&lt;*&gt;` in python, basically I just wanted to write haskell :P
Jimothy: at first I was going to convert the floats to pairs of church integers, at that point the `Fn` class was overloaded with `*` and `@` instead of `+` and `*`
Jimothy: then I got lazy</code></pre>
<h2 id="entry-12-file.py">Entry #12 (file.py)</h2>
<p>This one didn’t work for me. It created python scripts in its
directory, made HTTP requests, opened scary windows that immediately
closed, and who knows what else. Impressive and utterly
incomprehensible. Have a nice day.</p>
<h2 id="entry-13-cg14">Entry #13 (cg14)</h2>
<p>This is a simple little polyglot program in C, Python, and BQN.
Interestingly, the submitter has apparently forgotten that
<code>zip</code> in Python is not a method like it is in Rust, so I
suppose Rust is also here in spirit.</p>
